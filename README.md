# Rocketseat Next Level Week # 1
A full stack project made in 5 days on Next Level Week # 1 by Rocket Seat

The project is composed of 3 directories: server, web ...

## Server: Node JS
The Server folder contains the backend. All of the code was created using:

* Typescript and to run I use the lib ts-node which can be installed only on development mode with the command: `` `npm i ts-node -D` `the typescript was also installed only on development mode.
* Express JS to define the routes for our API.
* Knex to create the migrations and seeds of our SQLite database.

## Web: React JS
The Web folder contains the web application, which contains some features as navigation between pages and form submit integrated with the server-side. Detailing in a general way:

* ** react-router-dom ** to manage the routes for the pages of the app.
* ** react-icons ** to access different libs of icons in order to give more beauty for the app's design.
* ** react-leaflet ** and ** leaflet ** which contains a fully integration of maps allowing the use to pick their current location to save it on the database.
* ** axios ** to access the api created on the ** server ** folder.
* Concepts and usage of React JS with: useEffect, useState, changeEvent, formEvent and creation of components.
